# Epic 1: Job Opportunity Pipeline Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the **Job Opportunity Pipeline**, an end-to-end automated system designed to transform the user's job search from a manual, time-consuming effort into an intelligent, proactive, and highly personalized experience. The pipeline manages the entire lifecycle of a job opportunity, from initial discovery to final application tracking.

## Epic Goals

### Primary Objectives
-   **Automated Discovery**: Proactively and continuously scan a wide range of sources to find relevant job opportunities based on the user's profile and preferences.
-   **Intelligent Matching**: Go beyond simple keyword matching by using AI to score the relevance of each opportunity, considering skills, experience, career goals, and even company culture fit.
-   **Streamlined Application**: Drastically reduce the time and effort required to apply for jobs by automatically generating tailored, high-quality application materials (like CVs and cover letters).
-   **Centralized Tracking**: Provide a single, unified interface to track the status of all job applications, from "applied" to "offer received."
-   **Continuous Learning**: Implement a feedback loop where the system learns from the user's actions (e.g., which jobs they apply to, which they ignore) to improve the accuracy of future recommendations.

### Success Metrics
-   **Relevance**: A high percentage of the jobs presented to the user are deemed relevant and worth considering.
-   **Efficiency**: A significant reduction in the average time it takes for a user to find and apply for a suitable job.
-   **Engagement**: High user engagement with the generated content and application tracking features.
-   **Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback on the quality of job matches and tailored application materials.

## The User Journey

The pipeline is designed to guide the user, "Alex," through a seamless and empowering job search experience:

1.  **Setup**: Alex completes a one-time setup, providing their career profile, preferences (e.g., desired roles, locations, salary), and a base CV.
2.  **Automated Discovery**: The system takes over, continuously scanning job boards and other sources. Alex no longer needs to manually search for jobs.
3.  **Curation & Notification**: The system filters out the noise. Alex receives a curated list of high-relevance job opportunities through their preferred notification channel. Each opportunity is presented with a relevance score and a brief, AI-generated summary explaining *why* it's a good match.
4.  **Effortless Application**: For a job Alex is interested in, they can trigger the system to generate a tailored CV and cover letter with a single click. The system highlights the changes it made, giving Alex full transparency and control.
5.  **Centralized Tracking**: Once Alex applies, the job is automatically added to their personal application tracker. The system helps manage follow-ups and updates the status of each application as new information becomes available.

## Pipeline Stages

The Job Opportunity Pipeline is composed of four distinct, interconnected stages.

### 1. Discovery & Aggregation
-   **Purpose**: To cast a wide net and gather a comprehensive list of potential job opportunities from diverse sources.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Integrates with multiple job boards, company career pages, and professional networking sites via APIs and web scraping.
    -   Processes structured and unstructured data, including RSS feeds and newsletters.
    -   Standardizes and de-duplicates all incoming job data into a consistent format.

### 2. Matching & Relevance Scoring
-   **Purpose**: To intelligently filter the aggregated jobs and identify the most relevant opportunities for the user.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Uses AI models to perform a deep semantic analysis of the user's profile and the job description.
    -   Calculates a multi-faceted relevance score based on factors like skill alignment, experience level, salary expectations, location preferences, and company fit.
    -   Generates a human-readable "reasoning" summary that explains the score, highlighting the pros and cons of each opportunity.

### 3. Content Generation & Tailoring
-   **Purpose**: To assist the user in creating high-quality, personalized application materials that are optimized for each specific job.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   **CV Tailoring**: Modifies the user's base CV to highlight the skills and experiences most relevant to the target job. It can rephrase summaries, reorder bullet points, and ensure key terms from the job description are included.
    -   **Cover Letter Generation**: Creates a personalized cover letter from scratch, incorporating research about the company and aligning the user's story with the role's requirements.
    -   **Transparency**: Provides a clear "change log" that shows exactly what modifications were made to the base documents, giving the user full control and the ability to accept, reject, or edit the suggestions.

### 4. Application Tracking & Analytics
-   **Purpose**: To provide a centralized system for managing the application process and deriving insights from it.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Automatically logs every application the user submits through the system.
    -   Tracks the status of each application (e.g., Applied, Interviewing, Offer).
    -   Provides analytics on the user's job search, such as application response rates and the types of roles that are generating the most interest.
    -   Uses this data as a feedback loop to further refine the job matching and discovery process.
