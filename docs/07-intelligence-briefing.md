# Epic 3: Intelligence Briefing Specification

## Overview

This document details the **Intelligence Briefing** epic, a sophisticated system designed to cut through information overload and deliver personalized, actionable intelligence to the user. By aggregating content from a vast array of sources, synthesizing connections, and identifying trends, this feature provides a daily, strategic advantage.

## Epic Goals

### Primary Objectives
-   **Comprehensive Curation**: Automatically gather relevant news, research, and data from diverse, high-quality sources based on the user's specific interests and professional context.
-   **Deep Synthesis**: Go beyond simple aggregation to connect disparate pieces of information, identify underlying trends, and generate novel insights that are not obvious from any single source.
-   **Radical Personalization**: Tailor the content, structure, and narrative of each briefing to the user's individual role, industry, goals, and even their preferred reading style.
-   **Actionable Intelligence**: Frame all information in a way that is directly applicable to the user's work, highlighting opportunities, risks, and strategic implications.
-   **Effortless Delivery**: Deliver the briefing in a concise, easily digestible format through the user's preferred channel at the optimal time.

### Success Metrics
-   **Relevance**: The user consistently finds the content of the briefing to be highly relevant and valuable to their work.
-   **Insightfulness**: The briefing regularly provides the user with new insights or perspectives they would not have easily discovered on their own.
-   **Efficiency**: The user saves a significant amount of time on information gathering and analysis.
-   **Engagement**: High daily open and interaction rates for the briefing, indicating that it has become a valued part of the user's routine.

## The User Journey

The Intelligence Briefing is designed to be a "secret weapon" for the knowledge worker, "Marcus":

1.  **Initial Configuration**: Marcus sets up his profile, defining his industry (e.g., "Fintech"), role ("Product Manager"), and key areas of interest (e.g., "AI in lending," "competitor A," "blockchain regulation").
2.  **Automated Aggregation & Synthesis**: Overnight, the system scours the web, pulling from news APIs, academic journals, industry reports, social media, and more. It filters this firehose of information down to the most relevant and credible items. Crucially, it then "connects the dots" between them.
3.  **The Morning Briefing**: When Marcus starts his day, his personalized Intelligence Briefing is waiting for him. It doesn't just list articles; it tells a story. The executive summary might read: "Good morning, Marcus. The biggest story for you today is the new AI regulation proposed in the EU. This directly impacts your Q4 roadmap. We've also seen a surge in patent filings from Competitor A in the mobile payments space, suggesting a new product launch is imminent. Here's the breakdown..."
4.  **Deep Dives & Alerts**: The briefing provides high-level summaries but allows Marcus to click through to the source articles or a more detailed "deep dive" analysis prepared by the system. Throughout the day, if a truly critical piece of news breaks, the system can send him a real-time alert.
5.  **Feedback & Adaptation**: As Marcus interacts with the briefing—clicking on certain stories, dismissing others—the system learns and refines its understanding of his priorities, making the next day's briefing even more relevant.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Source Content Aggregation
-   **Purpose**: To build a comprehensive, high-quality dataset of potentially relevant information.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Connects to a wide variety of sources: News APIs, RSS feeds, social media platforms (e.g., X/Twitter, LinkedIn), academic research databases (e.g., arXiv), and financial filing repositories (e.g., SEC EDGAR).
    -   Employs a **quality assessment** layer to filter out unreliable sources, "clickbait," and low-quality content.
    -   Uses a sophisticated **de-duplication** engine to ensure the same story from multiple sources is treated as a single event.

### 2. Intelligent Content Filtering & Relevance Scoring
-   **Purpose**: To narrow down the vast pool of aggregated content to only that which is most relevant to the user.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Calculates a **multi-faceted relevance score** for each piece of content, considering:
        -   **Topic Relevance**: How closely does the content match the user's stated interests? (Uses semantic analysis, not just keywords).
        -   **Professional Context**: Is this relevant to someone in the user's role and industry?
        -   **Timeliness**: Is this breaking news, or is it part of a developing story?
        -   **Novelty**: Is this new information, or is it something the user has likely seen before?
    -   Applies **diversity filtering** to ensure the final selection of content covers a range of topics and avoids over-concentration on a single theme.

### 3. Content Synthesis & Trend Analysis
-   **Purpose**: This is the core of the epic—transforming information into intelligence.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   **Connection Discovery**: Identifies relationships between different pieces of content (e.g., "this news article about a company's funding round is related to this patent they just filed").
    -   **Insight Generation**: Groups related content into thematic clusters and generates a high-level insight that summarizes the key takeaway.
    -   **Trend Analysis**: Analyzes patterns over time to identify emerging trends, measure their momentum, and predict their trajectory.
    -   **Implication Analysis**: Assesses the potential impact of the synthesized insights and trends on the user's specific context (e.g., "What does this trend mean for your product?").

### 4. Personalization & Delivery
-   **Purpose**: To craft the final briefing and deliver it in the most effective way possible.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   **Personalized Narrative**: Generates a unique "executive summary" for each user, written in a tone and style that matches their preferences.
    -   **Adaptive Structure**: Organizes the content of the briefing based on the user's behavior (e.g., if the user always reads about competitors first, that section is placed at the top).
    -   **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Can deliver the briefing via email, a mobile push notification, or a dedicated web dashboard.
    -   **Optimized Timing**: Learns when the user is most likely to engage with the briefing and schedules delivery for that optimal time.
