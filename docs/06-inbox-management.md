# Epic 2: Inbox Management Specification

## Overview

This document describes the **Inbox Management** epic, a feature designed to transform a chaotic and overwhelming email inbox into a streamlined, intelligent, and actionable information source. The system automatically processes, categorizes, prioritizes, and summarizes incoming emails, empowering the user to stay on top of communications with minimal manual effort.

## Epic Goals

### Primary Objectives
-   **Automated Triage**: Intelligently categorize and prioritize all incoming emails, separating critical messages from informational content and noise.
-   **Action Extraction**: Automatically identify and extract actionable items, such as tasks, questions, and deadlines, from email content.
-   **Intelligent Summarization**: Condense long email threads and batches of related messages into concise, digestible summaries.
-   **Assisted Response**: Generate contextual, high-quality draft responses for common types of emails, significantly speeding up communication workflows.
-   **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously learn from the user's behavior (e.g., which emails they open first, how they categorize messages) to personalize and improve the accuracy of the system over time.

### Success Metrics
-   **Accuracy**: High percentage of emails correctly categorized and prioritized according to the user's needs.
-   **Efficiency**: Measurable reduction in the time the user spends managing their inbox daily.
-   **Actionability**: High success rate in identifying and flagging all emails that require a user action.
-   **Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback on the quality and relevance of email summaries and generated draft responses.

## The User Journey

The Inbox Management system is designed to fundamentally change how the user, "Sarah," interacts with her email:

1.  **Automated Processing**: As emails arrive in Sarah's inbox, the system processes them in the background. It reads the content, analyzes the sender, and understands the context.
2.  **Intelligent Organization**: Instead of a single, chronological list of emails, Sarah's inbox is now organized by priority and category. Urgent messages from key contacts are surfaced at the top, while newsletters and notifications are grouped together for later review.
3.  **Action-Oriented Briefings**: At the start of her day, Sarah receives a "Daily Digest" that summarizes key communications. It might say, "You have 3 urgent emails, including a project update from your manager and a question from a key client. There are also 5 meeting invitations to review."
4.  **Effortless Responses**: When Sarah opens an email that requires a response, the system provides a pre-written draft. For a meeting request, it might offer "Accept," "Decline," and "Propose New Time" buttons, each with a corresponding email draft ready to go.
5.  **Inbox Zero**: The system makes it easy to achieve "inbox zero." By processing emails in intelligent batches and providing the tools to act on them quickly, Sarah can clear her inbox with confidence, knowing that nothing important has been missed.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Email Processing & Ingestion
-   **Purpose**: To securely connect to the user's email account and process incoming messages in real-time.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Integrates with the user's email provider (e.g., Gmail) via their official API.
    -   Fetches new emails and parses their content, including the body, headers, and attachments.
    -   Cleans and standardizes the email data, stripping out unnecessary HTML formatting and signatures to prepare it for analysis.
    -   Processes attachments, including scanning them for security threats and extracting text content from documents like PDFs and Word files.

### 2. Intelligent Categorization
-   **Purpose**: To automatically assign a meaningful category to every email.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Employs a **multi-level classification system** that uses a combination of techniques for high accuracy.
    -   **Rule-Based Engine**: Applies a set of predefined and user-customizable rules for clear-cut cases (e.g., "if the subject contains 'invoice', categorize as 'Financial'").
    -   **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a trained model to understand the nuances of email content and categorize messages that don't fit simple rules.
    -   **Sender Analysis**: Considers the relationship with the sender. An email from a direct manager is treated differently than an email from an unknown sender.

### 3. Priority Scoring
-   **Purpose**: To determine the importance and urgency of each email, allowing the user to focus on what matters most.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Calculates a **comprehensive priority score** for each email based on a weighted combination of factors:
        -   **Sender Importance**: Is the email from a VIP, a frequent contact, or a mailing list?
        -   **Content Urgency**: Does the email contain words like "urgent," "deadline," or "asap"?
        -   **Actionability**: Does the email explicitly ask a question or request an action?
        -   **User Behavior**: Has the user historically prioritized emails from this sender or on this topic?
    -   Assigns a clear priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to each message.

### 4. Summarization & Briefing Generation
-   **Purpose**: To distill large volumes of email into short, easy-to-understand summaries.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Can summarize a single long email or an entire thread.
    -   Generates **daily or weekly briefings** that provide a high-level overview of inbox activity.
    -   Identifies and extracts key insights, such as emerging themes in communication or a sudden increase in emails from a specific project.

### 5. Response Generation
-   **Purpose**: To assist the user in replying to emails more quickly and efficiently.
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Determines whether an email actually requires a response.
    -   For emails that do, it identifies the likely **intent** (e.g., scheduling a meeting, answering a question).
    -   Generates a complete, high-quality **draft response** based on the context of the email and the user's own writing style.
    -   Provides multiple response options where appropriate (e.g., accept/decline).
